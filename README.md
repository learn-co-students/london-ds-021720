This is the repository for the London Data Science Cohort Len(Ranger)rs!

Here you can find all of our lecture materials and materials needed for the course.

##Â Restructure!!

Note that all `Mod 1` materials are found in `this repository`. 
Moving forward into `Mod 2` and beyond, we will be transitioning to a repo-per-lecture style of sharing information.
This is designed to...

* Eliminate merge issues 
* Allow students to continue to access future versions of lectures after they graduate
* Provide for a more uniform learning experience across cohorts
* Allow instructors to better contribute to materials across lessons

We will still use this repo for sharing information with the cohort and further link to each repo used via this `README.md`.
